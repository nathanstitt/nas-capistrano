# Nas::Capistrano

This is a small collection of capistrano recipes I've put together to
make deploying to my servers a bit easier

I have no intention of submitting to ruby-gems

Feel free to pick and choose if you wish, but it's not a turnkey
solution by any meants.  I doubt it'll be much use to others as-is.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'nas-capistrano', :git=>https://github.com/nathanstitt/nas-capistrano.git

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nas-capistrano
